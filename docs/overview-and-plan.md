# Dash - Admin Panel Framework for Dart

## Overview

Dash is a modern, full-featured admin panel framework for Dart, inspired by FilamentPHP. Built on top of Jaspr, it provides a powerful and elegant way to create beautiful admin interfaces for your Dart applications and websites.

### Core Philosophy

## Recent Improvements (November 2025)

### Configuration & Developer Experience
- ✅ **Command-line database path**: Added support for specifying database directory via CLI args
- ✅ **VS Code integration**: Updated launch configurations to pass database directory
- ✅ **Resource defaults**: Auto-generate labels from model names, reducing boilerplate
- ✅ **Navigation groups**: Organized sidebar navigation with collapsible groups
- ✅ **Cleaner resources**: Minimal resource definitions with smart defaults

### Example Resource Before:
```dart
class UserResource extends Resource<User> {
  @override
  Type get model => User;
  @override
  String get label => 'Users';
  @override
  String get singularLabel => 'User';
  @override
  String? get navigationGroup => 'Administration';
  @override
  int get navigationSort => 1;
  @override
  Heroicon get iconComponent => const Heroicon(HeroIcons.userGroup);
}
```

### Example Resource After:
```dart
class UserResource extends Resource<User> {
  @override
  Type get model => User;
  @override
  Heroicon get iconComponent => const Heroicon(HeroIcons.userGroup);
  @override
  String? get navigationGroup => 'Administration';
  // label and singularLabel auto-derived from User model name!
}
```

### Core Technologies

- **Frontend Framework**: Jaspr (for component-based UI)
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS (via Jaspr integration) or custom CSS
- **State Management**: Built-in with Jaspr signals/state
- **Routing**: Jaspr router
- **HTTP**: shelf or dart:http
- **Database**: Agnostic (support multiple ORMs)

### Key Design Patterns

- **Builder Pattern**: For forms, tables, and resources
- **Factory Pattern**: For field and widget creation
- **Observer Pattern**: For events and hooks
- **Strategy Pattern**: For authentication providers
- **Decorator Pattern**: For middleware and plugins

## Installation Vision

The goal is to make installation as simple as:

```bash
# Add dependency
dart pub add dash

# Initialize panel
dart run dash:init

# Create first resource
dart run dash:make:resource User
```

Then in your application:

```dart
import 'package:dash/dash.dart';

void main() {
  final panel = Panel()
    ..resources([
      UserResource(),
      PostResource(),
    ])
    ..dashboard(CustomDashboard())
    ..theme(DarkTheme());
  
  // Integrate with your server
  runApp(panel);
}
```

## Success Metrics

- Easy to install and get started (< 5 minutes)
- Intuitive API that follows Dart conventions
- Comprehensive documentation
- Active community and plugin ecosystem
- Performance on par with or better than web alternatives
- Type-safety throughout the entire stack

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Create initial documentation
2. Set up the monorepo package structure
3. Initialize the core `dartboard` package with Jaspr
4. Define the base interfaces (Panel, Resource, Form, Table)
5. Create a proof-of-concept with a single resource
6. Iterate and build out Phase 1
